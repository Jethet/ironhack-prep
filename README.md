# ironhack-prep
Repo to publish exercises and challenges from prep work for Ironhack bootcamp Full Stack Web Development, Jan - March 2019.
The prep work is divided into three modules: Environment Setup, including CLI, Git and GitHub; Javascript; and HTML & CSS basics.

The repo has been created so that the TAs from Ironhack have access to the code of the exercises and challenges.

I made some changes in the exercises here and there, not reducing any of the functionality or learning aspects but more to add variation and maybe make them a bit more fun to read.
