            <h1>The header section</h1>
            <p><i>Note: I have used HTML and CSS a bit already when I did courses on Python and Django. I also built my <a href="http://www.elevador-bcn.es">own website already</a>, without any assistance. It needs work to make it better suitable for mobile screens, but that will have to wait until I have time.</i></p>
            <p><i>The website is rather straightforward: I had just a week to build it and the resizing of the photos took most of the time. I did not want to use CSS, to keep it simple, and instead chose a beautiful, open source font that would provide sufficient style and class.</i></p>

            <p>Hello there!</p>
            <p>This is a bit of a boring webpage, no? I am sure we can do better ...

            <p>Let's add a nice picture!

            <p>Maybe I will tell you about me, but it won't be much. This is about learning to code properly, as far as I am concerned.</p>
