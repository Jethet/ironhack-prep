This is a project folder to save the CodePen project Ironskydive, to have access offline as well as online. Having this project folder locally enables me to work on the project when I do not have internet access.

The project entails the building of a website for the fictional Ironskydive company, to practise working with HTML and CSS. It is a guided project.
